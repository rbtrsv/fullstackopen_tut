# Phonebook

Link to the online application:
[Full Stack](https://phonebook-backend-fullstackopen-s85n.onrender.com)

NB: The link states backend just because I assumed only the backend will be deployed.

NB: When I run "npm run build" a "build" folder is being created. From my research Vite and Webpack outputs "dist" by default while Create React App outputs "build". My phonebook exercise was done a long time ago.
